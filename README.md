### Hey, I'm Zala ğŸ‘‹

I'm a student at Noroff, studying Frontend development. I'm finishing my first year of studies, and enjoy learning new things.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my portfolio.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for an internship or a job.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- âš¡ Fun fact: in my free time I love to bake, play board games and go climbing.
