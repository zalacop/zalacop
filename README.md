### Hey, I'm Zala ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently finishing my Frontend Development studies at Noroff. Throughout my studies, I've gained a deep appreciation for the amount of work that goes into creating a website. I find it fascinating how many different ways there are to achieve the same results. Just like in baking, web development has many layers that come together to create a work of art.

I enjoy learning new things and challenging myself. This field is especially appealing to me because it is constantly evolving, always offering something new to learn. While I know I still have a lot to learn, I'm looking forward to improving my skills and growing as a developer.
